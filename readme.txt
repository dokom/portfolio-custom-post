This plugin allows for users to be able to create a portfolio category, and be able to display them via a shortcode, or a widget.

== Description ==
For this assignment, we were required to create a plugin that will create
a custom post type, a shortcode, and a widget for the custom post type.
Ideally, this plugin will create a custom post type that will be used for
a portfolio gallery purpose.
With the ability to display featured images from the portfolio project, users
are able to display these featured images through the use of a widget on a sidebar,
or the use of a shortcode on a page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the 'wp-content/plugins/portfolio-custom-post' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

== Portfolio Usage ==

1. Once the plugin is installed, you will see a "Portfolio" menu item on your dashboard.
2. Just like adding a new post, hover over the menu item, and click on "Add New". This will direct you to a page where you can create a post.
3. To add a featured image, which will be the main image you display on your site, scroll down the right hand side until you reach "Set Featured Image"
	3.1 If your image is already uploaded to your media files, then pick which image you would like. If not, upload your image and select it.
4. To create a gallery of your images, click on 'Add Media', which would be right under the title.
	4.1 From here, on the left side, there will be an option to "Create Gallery".
	4.2 Once you select that option, you can pick as many of the images you would like.
5. Submit or Update the changes of the page to save

== Widget Usage ==

1. Click on "Appearance->Widgets" on the dashboard
2. You will receive a list of widgets for you to use. For this plugin, the widget title is "Featured Images". This will display all of your most recent posts.
3. When you open up the widget, you will get the opportunity to determine how many images are displayed within the widget. You can have up to 6 posts displayed at once.

== Shortcode Usage ==

1. Create a new post or page
2. Type "[portfolio]" in the text editor
3. Save the page or post
4. Your most recent posts from the portfolio will be displayed.
